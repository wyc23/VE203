# Cardinality

For every set $A$, there is a unique cardinal $\kappa$ with $A \approx \kappa$. We call $\kappa$ the cardinality of $A$, denoted by $cardA = \kappa$. 

- $card[n] = n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- $card\mathbb{N} = \alef_0$.
- $card\mathbb{R} = 2^{\alef_0}$.

## Ordering cardinals

A set $A$ is dominated by a set $B$ (written $A \preceq B$) if there is an injection from $A$ to $B$.

We write $card A \leq card B$ if $A \preceq B$; $card A < card B$ if $A \preceq B$ and $A \not \approx B$.

## Countable set

A set $A$ is countable if $A \preceq \mathbb{N}$. Otherwise it is called uncountable.

## Cantor-Schroder-Bernstein theorem

$(A \preceq B) \wedge (B \preceq A) \Rightarrow A \approx B$.
