# Finite Sets and Pigeonhole Principle

## finite set

For any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $[n] := \lbrace 1, \dots , n \rbrace$, with $[0] = \emptyset$.

A set is finite if it is equinumerous to $[n]$ for some $n$. A set is infinite is it is not finite.

## Pigeonhole principle

No set of the form $[n]$ is equinumerous to a proper subset of itself, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

### corollary

- No finite set is equinumerous to a proper subset of itself.
- $\mathbb{N}$ is infinite.
- Every finite set is equinumerous to a unique natural number.
- Any subset of a finite set is finite.

### other version

Let $r, s \in \mathbb{N} - \lbrace 0 \rbrace$, if a set containing at least $rs + 1$ elements is partitioned into $r$ subsets, then some subsets contains at least $s + 1$ elements.
